#The Talking Hat

The talking hat from the Harry Potter series implemented using an Arduino microcontroller.

It works by asking the user to put it on and, after being put on, asks questions to determine the house of Hogwarts, the user belongs to. Those questions can be answered by nodding or shaking your head.
Once the questions are answered, the user is notified about the house he was assigned to.
